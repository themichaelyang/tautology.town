A [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology) is something that restates itself in a redundant way, sort of the opposite of an oxymoron. Like, "an added bonus", "ATM machine" (Automated Teller Machine machine), or "if you know, you know" (my personal favorite).

In logic, a tautology is a formula that is necessarily true, or a statement that is self-evident. This is to say, a logical tautology isn’t really saying anything at all.

Style guides suggest finding and removing tautologies from writing. I agree — the best writing advice I ever got was: "Write less." 

The catch with writing very little is that you don't get very good at writing. I want to write a lot, publish more, and get better.

To err on the side of do, [tautology.town](https://tautology.town) will inevitably be home to drafts, scraps and, of course, tautologies. 

And, I hope, some good stuff too.
