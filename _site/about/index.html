    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology">tautology</a> is something that restates itself in a redundant way, sort of the opposite of an oxymoron. Like, “an added bonus”, “ATM machine” (Automated Teller Machine machine), or “if you know, you know” (my personal favorite).</p>

<p>In logic, a tautology is a formula that is necessarily true, or a statement that is self-evident. This is to say, a logical tautology isn’t really saying anything at all.</p>

<p>Style guides suggest finding and removing tautologies from writing. I agree — the best writing advice I ever got was: “Write less.”</p>

<p>The catch with writing very little is that you don’t get very good at writing. I want to write a lot, publish more, and get better.</p>

<p>To err on the side of do, the tautology.town will inevitably be home to drafts, scraps and, of course, tautologies.</p>

<p>And, I hope, some good stuff too.</p>
