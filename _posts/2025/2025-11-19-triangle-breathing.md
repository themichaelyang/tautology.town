title: "Triangle breathing"
---

This is a breathing exercise that has helped me during some difficult times, past and present. It grounds me when I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's called "triangle breathing", although I think of it as 3-3-3. 

You can try it right now. It only takes a few seconds:

> Close your eyes.
>
> Breathe in for 3 counts; hold for 3 counts; breathe out for 3 counts; take a slight pause.
>
> Then repeat, at least 3 times.

I find it more comfortable than "box breathing" (4-4-4-4), which is often recommended. 

Here are my pointers:

- I find it helps to slow down counting with a "[Mississippi](https://separatedbyacommonlanguage.blogspot.com/2012/04/counting-seconds.html)" and be flexible with the timing by listening to my body, breathing or pausing longer or shorter as needed.
- I find it easier when my back is straighter (sitting or supine) and try to breathe into my stomach, rather than my chest.
- If I practice this occasionally when I'm not in immediate stress, it makes it easier to remember and do when I am stressed.
- It's not a panacea, just another tool to help you in a pinch. Go outside, go for a walk, write down your feelings, talk with friends. Take a break!

I've taught this to others in my life who have found it helpful; I hope it can help you too.
